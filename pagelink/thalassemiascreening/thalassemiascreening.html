    <p>Planning a family is a special and life-changing experience, but it also comes with important responsibilities.
      One of the most crucial steps in this process is to ensure that both partners are aware of potential health risks
      that could affect their future children. Among these risks, thalassaemia is a serious condition that can impact
      the health of a child and the well-being of the entire family. This is why thalassaemia screening should be a
      priority before marriage and pregnancy.

      Thalassaemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin. Both partners may unknowingly
      carry the thalassaemia gene, and without screening, they might be unaware of the risk they face in having a child
      with this condition. </p>
    <p>Thalassaemia screening before marriage and pregnancy is crucial for couples who are planning to start a family.
      By identifying the risks early, couples can reduce the emotional, financial, and physical strain that often
      accompanies raising a child with this genetic condition.

      Raising awareness about thalassaemia screening and empowering couples with knowledge allows them to make informed
      decisions that will lead to healthier, more prepared families. Early screening is not just about preventing a
      genetic disorderâ€”it's about giving parents the tools they need to plan for a bright and healthy future.</p>
