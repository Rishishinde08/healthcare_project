    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 1.28 billion adults aged 30 to 79 worldwide have high
      blood pressure, yet nearly half of them are unaware about it.Most people aren't fully aware of how it impacts the
      body or how to spot early warning signs. This lack of awareness can make it harder to manage blood pressure
      effectively. World Hypertension Day serves as a reminder to take the time to learn more about this condition and
      how to maintain healthy blood pressure. With better understanding, it becomes easier to make small changes that
      can lead to better overall well-being. Before we dive into what hypertension is and how to manage it, let's first
      take a look at the purpose of World Hypertension Day.</p>
    <p>Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against the walls of
      your arteries is consistently too high. This can occur over many years without noticeable symptoms, which is why
      it's often referred to as a "silent" condition. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is
      recorded with two numbers: systolic pressure (the higher number, measuring the pressure when the heart beats) and
      diastolic pressure (the lower number, measuring the pressure when the heart rests between beats).
