    <p>World Brain Tumour Day, observed on 8 June each year, was established to draw attention to brain tumours and
      emphasise the need to increase awareness about them. The day encourages communities to learn more about this
      condition, recognise possible symptoms, and support early diagnosis. Awareness helps improve outcomes by making
      people more alert to early stage brain tumour symptoms that may otherwise go unnoticed. In this article, we look
      at the origins and purpose of World Brain Tumour Day, and provide key information about brain tumours, including
      their types, causes, signs, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
    <p>World Brain Tumour Day was launched on 8 June 2000 by the German Brain Tumour Association. It began as a national
      effort to draw attention to the challenges faced by those diagnosed with brain tumours and to honour the work of
      researchers and healthcare teams. In the years that followed, the International Brain Tumour Alliance joined the
      initiative, transforming it into a global observance.</p>
