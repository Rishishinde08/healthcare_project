    <p>For many people, smoking or chewing tobacco starts as a way to manage stress or feel a sense of comfort on a busy
      day. Over time, what starts as a mere distraction becomes something impossible to quit, even when they want to.
      Letting go of tobacco isn't easy, especially when it's been part of daily life for years, but it's important to
      know that change is possible, and the benefits can be life-changing - not only for you but also for your loved
      ones. That's where World No Tobacco Day, observed every year on 31st May, plays a role. It's a reminder that
      you're not alone, and that support is out there for anyone ready to take that first step. This blog talks about
      why quitting tobacco matters more now than ever before, how it benefits your body and mind, and ways that can help
      you take that first step towards quitting. Let's begin by looking at the history and meaning behind this day.</p>
    <p>World No Tobacco Day was established in 1987 by the World Health Organization to draw attention to the rising use
      of tobacco and its harmful effects on health. The aim was to encourage people across the world to stop using
      tobacco and to raise awareness about the risks linked to both smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco. Since then,
      31 May has been marked each year with campaigns that focus on different health themes, such as protecting young
      people from tobacco marketing or exposing the impact of tobacco on heart and lung health.</p>
