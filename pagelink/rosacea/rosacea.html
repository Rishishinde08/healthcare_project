    <p>Rosacea is a common skin condition that is often mistaken for acne or skin sensitivity, which delays diagnosis,
      allowing symptoms such as redness, visible blood vessels, and flare-ups to worsen. As the symptoms and associated
      triggers differ from person to person, identifying what causes flare-ups can be challenging. That said, learning
      more about the condition can help you recognise the triggers and manage the symptoms effectively. This article
      covers everything on rosacea including the treatments that can help manage its symptoms. Let's start with the
      basics.Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that primarily affects the face. It typically develops in cycles of flare-ups and remissions, meaning symptoms may come and go over time.. Rosacea is more common in fair-skinned individuals and often worsens with triggers such as sun exposure, stress, spicy foods, or alcohol. Though there is no cure, proper treatment and lifestyle adjustments can help manage symptoms effectively.

    <p>In conclusion, thalassaemia screening is a vital step for couples considering marriage and pregnancy. It not only
      helps in understanding the genetic risks involved but also empowers couples to make informed choices for a
      healthier future.Not everyone with rosacea reacts to the same triggers, so identifying triggers that affect you and avoiding them can help manage flare-ups effectively.
