    <p>Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is a medical condition in which a woman's ovaries generate immature or partially mature eggs in large numbers during reproductive age. These eggs develop into cysts in the ovaries over time. Due to the cysts, ovaries become large & secrete large amounts of male hormones (androgen) which causes infertility problems, irregular periods, unwanted weight gain, and other health issues.

While relatively common, most women are not aware of the signs and symptoms of PCOD, the implications of the condition, and available treatment options. So let us take a closer look.</p>
    <p>Millions of women across the world are diagnosed with PCOD each year. However, no medical evidence establishes a link between PCOD and ovarian cancer.

Women diagnosed with PCOS are at an increased risk of developing cancer of the endometrium, which is the uterus lining. This is often a result of chronic exposure to oestrogen and exacerbated by comorbid conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.

Women suffering from PCOS may also have a 2 to 3 times higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.

The link between PCOS and breast cancer is not very clear. Researchers have not established a link between a PCOS diagnosis and the risk of developing breast cancer. However, the hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS leads doctors to be wary.

If you suffer from PCOS, your gynaecologist may likely recommend periodic screening for breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.
